## What is this game?

Welcome to the Spider Mansion Web Demo! This web version gives you a glimpse of how the game will eventually look in Unity. In this horror puzzle game, you step into the shoes of a nanny tasked with caring for a young girl named Eva. Brace yourself for a series of chilling puzzles.

## How we started

One of our teammates had the interesting idea of adapting lateral thinking puzzles into horror visual-novel game. These puzzles typically require discussion with another person to solve. We decided to collaborate with a technology student with a strong interest in AI, which led us to the idea of incorporating AI into the puzzle itself.

Instead of simply creating an emotional NPC with AI, we're training the AI to focus on the puzzle's narrative, essentially turning this human interaction requirement into the core gameplay mechanic.

Visually, the game will have an early 2000s horror RPG aesthetic, contrasting with the modern twist of using an AI communication system as the main gameplay mechanic.

## Why you should play it
